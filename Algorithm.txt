The algorithm for the given code is as follows:

1. Create a class called "Experience" with the following attributes:
   - company
   - job_title
   - start_date
   - end_date
   Define an __init__ method to initialize these attributes.
   Define a method called "display_exper" to display the experience details.

2. Create a class called "Education" with the following attributes:
   - degree
   - institution
   - completion_date
   Define an __init__ method to initialize these attributes.
   Define a method called "display_education" to display the education details.

3. Create a class called "Skill" with the following attributes:
   - skill
   - percentage
   Define an __init__ method to initialize these attributes.
   Define a method called "dis_skill" to display the skill details.

4. Create a class called "CV" with the following attributes:
   - experience (list to store Experience objects)
   - education (list to store Education objects)
   - skill (list to store Skill objects)
   Define an __init__ method to initialize these attributes.

5. Implement methods in the "CV" class to perform the following actions:
   - add_exper(): Ask the user to input the details of their experience, create an Experience object with these details, and append it to the "experience" list.
   - add_edu(): Ask the user to input the details of their education, create an Education object with these details, and append it to the "education" list.
   - add_skill(): Ask the user to input the details of their skill, create a Skill object with these details, and append it to the "skill" list.
   - cv_dis(): Display the CV details by iterating through the "experience", "education", and "skill" lists and calling the respective display methods.

6. In the main section of the code, create an instance of the "CV" class and call the add_exper(), add_edu(), add_skill(), and cv_dis() methods to create and display the CV.
